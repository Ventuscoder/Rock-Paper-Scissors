# Rock-Paper-Scissors
 A simple rock-paper-scissors application that is browser console based.
 It took me a lot of time to complete the front-end version of this game. 
 I kept on mixing up the functions, commenting out large blocks of code, but the outcome of the hard work seems to be good.
 I credit my success to [theodinproject](http://theodinproject.com) largely.
